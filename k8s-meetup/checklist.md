I have found it easiest when a sponsor brings food and beverage themselves. This saves us back-and-forth with credit card numbers and emailing receipts for expense reports. If you'd rather just pay for food and let me organize it, I can do that too.

### Food / bev sponsors
**Thank you** for supporting us with quality food and bev, we really appreciate it! Here's a few popular ideas for food/drinks.

**There is no sink or kitchen supplies.**

*Remember, there's a good percentage of vegetarians in the group. Please plan for them too!*

#### Food ideas
![Catering options](/assets/catering-foods.jpg)
- Sandwiches and wraps ([Panera](https://catering.panerabread.com/) is a popular option)
- Middle Eastern food (my favorite!). For example, Roll-Up Combos from [Shawarma Falafel](https://shawarmafalafel.com/).
- Burritos (eg Burrito box with [Chipotle catering](https://catering.chipotle.com/))
- Pizza. I've used [Regina's Pizzeria via Grubhub](https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/regina-pizzeria-700-atlantic-ave-boston/455357). 

#### Drinks

Cans of seltzers / water / soda is easiest. Alcohol isn't allowed by our host. I typically plan for 1.25 cans per attendee. Use anything that remains at your next bbq.

- multiple 12-packs of cans of flavored seltzer waters, PLUS
- 1-2 packs of bottled water (Water is more popular than I originally anticipated)

#### Sides / snacks
It's often nice to have a side or snack alongside the food. Here's some typical ideas

- large salads (easy side order if you use Panera)
- cookies (again, an easy option from Panera)
- chips and salsa (for example, these can be included with burritos from Chipotle)

#### Other
Please don't forget about the following items. This can save us a last-minute scramble.

- paper plates
- paper towels
- napkins
- knives and forks (compostable if possible)
- cups (if not cans/bottles)

#### Tips for sponsors
- **RSVP for yourself** and colleagues on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/boston-kubernetes-meetup) so that your badge is printed when you arrive.
- **Parking**. Street parking does exist in Cambridge but I find it easiest to park at [Kendall Center Green Garage](https://www.kendallcenter.com/location/).
- **Swag / raffle items**. (Not required at all). If you'd like to donate a raffle item, think of a funny question for the audience and use your item as a prize.
