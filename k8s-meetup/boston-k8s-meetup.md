I'm the host of the [Boston Kubernetes Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/boston-kubernetes-meetup) and I love helping others learn the technology. The meetup is a great place for newbies and experienced engineers alike to network in the professional community.

The CNCF also has a [community chapter in Boston](https://community.cncf.io/boston). I am the leader of this group, although the platform is less active than the community found on Meetup.com. In most major cities this appears to be true - most Kubernetes and CNCF-related networking is done via Meetup.com groups.
