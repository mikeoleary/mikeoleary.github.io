- Docker is open source and there's many ways to install on Ubuntu.
- you can install manually using multiple methods and from various package managers that come with your OS
  - in the past, I have used the docker.io package because I didn't know a better way
  - now, I prefer to use these instructions because they come from Docker's website: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
    - I prefer to use apt-get because it's easy, but I'd like to pull the package from Docker's repository for Apt. Here's a link to that spot in the doc: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository
