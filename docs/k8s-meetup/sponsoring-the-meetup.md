### Why should I sponsor the Boston Kubernetes Meetup?
- reach smart, motivated engineers in Boston
- inexpensive way to support the community with good will
- I always share your logo and say thanks a few times during the MC portion

### How much does it cost?
Around $12 - $15 per person. I ask a sponsor to provide food and beverages only. Google provide a venue to meet.

I've created a [checklist](/meetup/sponsor-checklist) if you are willing to sponsor with food and beverages.

We typically get around 50 people at an event. If you were to spend $15/head, that's $750.

### Can I bring swag?
Sure, but it's not required at all. We focus on the technology, so the rule of "no sales pitches" applies to all presentations - even if you're sponsoring food and bev. But hey, everyone loves free stuff! So if you want to donate a raffle item or just give away stickers, have at it.
