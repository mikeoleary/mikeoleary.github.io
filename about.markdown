I'm a Solution Architect at F5 and I love my job. My work revolves around F5's core strength: application delivery. This usually involves diving into network security, cloud architecture, automation, Linux, Azure, AWS, etc.  

Over time I've specialized in Kubernetes and am now a go-to resource for Kubernetes-related technologies for colleagues. 

### Meetup
I'm also the host of the [Boston Kubernetes Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/boston-kubernetes-meetup), and a co-lead of the [Boston chapter](https://community.cncf.io/boston) of the CNCF Community Groups. If you'd like to join us or present at our events, please reach out.

### About this site
Occasionally I post an article to document how I configured this tech blog. This site is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll), which means it's free, git-based, and has a large community of support. 

Like all systems, documentation is key to supportability. Posts in the 'blogging' category have notes of almost everything I've done to set up this site.
