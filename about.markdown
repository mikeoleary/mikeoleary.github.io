I'm a Solution Architect at F5 and I love my job. My work revolves around F5's core strength: application delivery. This usually involves diving into network security, cloud architecture, automation, Linux, Azure, AWS, etc.  

Over time I've specialized in Kubernetes and am now a go-to resource for Kubernetes-related technologies for colleagues. 

I'm also the host of the [Boston Kubernetes Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/boston-kubernetes-meetup), and a co-lead of the [Boston chapter](https://community.cncf.io/boston) of the CNCF Community Groups. If you'd like to join us or present at our events, please reach out.

When I'm not working, I mostly enjoy spending time with my wife and two kids. But if I can fit it in, motorcycle riding, soccer, and traveling to see family are favorite activities too.
